Movies from the provided APIs contains only year, but the client expect a release date. Something may need to be fixed in the proided API?
What does ImdbId means in the ApiAPplication? as in the providedApi we just have ImdbRating and ImdbCount.
It is not indicated if we should use id endpoint to get a movie or use the search endpoint. I asume it depends on the frontend, I use the id endpoint for now.
